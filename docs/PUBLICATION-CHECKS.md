# Publication validation — 2026-11-07

- `npm run check`: **37 Node tests passed**; generated runtime syntax passed.
- Disposable native-profile smoke tests: **47 checks passed** on macOS Zen **1.24.1b**. No existing profile opened or modified by these tests.
- Native results are in `browser-results.json`. Sine injection/unload is emulated; this is not a full Sine marketplace installer test.
- No Windows/Linux GUI certification. Native app/desktop focus, fullscreen, multiple monitors, and physical Dock behavior remain manual acceptance where applicable.
- Publication-only changes: repository metadata/docs, self-contained test tooling and explicit safe packaging; installed browser files/settings were not changed. No profile state, credentials, raw browser logs or third-party Little Zen source are distributed.
